# New group member IT instuctions
1. You will be given an email forwarder derived from your name, e.g. John Smith => j.smith@intbio.org
Please, use this email for registering to all work related services. This is just a forwarder - any email sent to @intbio.org will be frowarded to your personal email.
2. Register on github.com with this email. Your user name should be like j-smith , or if it is taken j-smith-biomsu. NB(!) - use dashes not dots, between your name letter and surname.
3. Please register at https://www.zotero.org . Zotero is a reference and citation manager used in our group.
4. Send your GitHub and Zotero username and email to info@intbio.org . You will then get an invite to intbio organization and group on GitHub (https://github.com/intbio)  and Zotero - check your email and also account pages at Github and Zotero.
5. For communications we use slack https://slack.com . Install it . Use this link to signup to a group workspace https://join.slack.com/t/intbiol/signup . You may also get an invitation to a relevant project channel if you plan to work on a specific project - so check you email.
6. Likely you will also get an account on [newton.bioeng.ru](https://newton.bioeng.ru/jupyter) , which will be like j_smith
7. Likely you will also get an account on Redmine https://newton.bioeng.ru/redmine/
8. If you are doing experimental work, register on http://benchling.com
9. Please, send any further qestions to the #helpdesk channel in Slack!

## Basic IT training

1. Familiarise yourself with using newton https://github.com/intbio/IT_notes/blob/master/newton_cheatsheet.md
2. Most likely you'll need to understand how to use Linux, Git, Jupyter notebooks and program in Python. Please, use this Crash course to learn it https://github.com/intbio/IntBioEdu/blob/master/ITcc.md

## For students planning to do Molecular Dynamics simulations
1. Look at the Gromacs tutorials here https://github.com/intbio/MolModEdu
2. Start with this one https://github.com/intbio/MolModEdu/tree/master/GROMACS/nucl
3. On github there is a repo https://github.com/intbio/gmx_template It allows you to start any simulation through a Jupyter notebook on Newton cluster. Activate the 'moldyn' kernel for that.
4. https://github.com/intbio/IT_notes/blob/master/lomonosov.md https://github.com/intbio/IT_notes/blob/master/lomo_quick.md
